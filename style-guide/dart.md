## Style Guide For Dart

### Identifiers
Identifiers come in three flavors in Dart.

UpperCamelCase names capitalize the first letter of each word, including the first.

lowerCamelCase names capitalize the first letter of each word, except the first which is always lowercase, even if itâ€™s an acronym.

lowercase_with_underscores use only lowercase letters, even for acronyms, and separate words with _.
